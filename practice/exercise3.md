# 🏋️ Exercise: Exploring the FAIRness of datasets

## Objectives

-   Familiarise you with finding datasets in different repositories
-   Assessing the FAIRness of a dataset should help you reflect on:
-   What should you do or not do when you publish the data of your project? 
-   Did you identify things missing in this dataset that you would definitely provide when you publish yours?
-   Allow you to explore how datasets are published in different repositories
    
## Instructions

1.  Choose a dataset that interests you just by reading the title
    
2.  Search for the dataset with the provided title. Feel free to use your usual search methods - no restrictions there
    
3.  Once you find the dataset (not the publication, not the report, you need to find the dataset) reflect on how Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable (FAIR) you think this dataset is.
    
4.  You can download the following template to guide you with your assessment:
    
5.  If none of the titles we provide are interesting for you, you can search for datasets in the following data repositories using keywords that are relevant for your research field:

	- Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/](https://zenodo.org/)
    
	-  Dryad: [https://datadryad.org/stash](https://datadryad.org/stash)
