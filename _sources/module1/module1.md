# Module 2: Essentials for Research Data

## Learning goals

In this module, we start to dig deeper into RDM by introducing multiple topics concerning the essentials of RDM.

At the end of this module you should be able to:

1. Identify different types of research data

2. Recognize what is considered confidential data in research

3. Realize what RDM entails within a research project

4. Recognize the responsibilities regarding RDM for TUD PhD candidates

5. Store and back up the research data of your project in a secure manner

## Topic 1: Data within the research workflow
Watch the presentation about the importance of RDM and hear what other researchers have as their worst nightmare. Why should you be aware of your Research Data Management?

### Research data definitions


Research data is any information that has been collected, observed, generated or created to validate research findings.

Depending on the discipline you work in, research data can be collected or produced in different ways. You can capture them in real-time (e.g. sensors, images), you can collect them using laboratory instruments and they can derive from interviews or numerical simulations, among others. 

Research Data can be digital such as tabular data, videos, algorithms, scripts, transcripts, codebooks, etc. But, they can also be non-digital, for example, laboratory samples, sketchbooks, prototypes, etc.

We talked to some TU Delft researchers working in different disciplines and we asked them: ‘What is the research data you work with?’ Let’s see what they shared with us:
