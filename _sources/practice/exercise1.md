# 🏋️ Exercise: Data Flow Map Part 1

During this course we encourage our learners to work on their own research data management strategy and reflect on different themes based on the data they expect to collect/produce.

We encourage the self-learners following the course through this Jupyter book to take the time and do this reflection exercise. You can maybe ask one of your team members to provide feedback on your data flow map.

After completing Module 1 and Module 2, you should reflect on the type of research data/software you are collecting/producing, provide a description of them and to create your own back-up and storage strategy for the data of your project applying what you have learned.

Bellow, you will find a template and a step-by-step guide PDF to help you structure the different aspects of the data flow map.
