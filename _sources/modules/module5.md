# Module 5 - How to plan for RDM

In module 5 we will take a closer look at planning for RDM. In relation to this, data management plans and the tool DMPonline will be further explained. 

```{admonition} At the end of this module you should be able to:
* Recognize the relevance of planning research data management   
* Get familiar with the concept of DMP and its format 
* Create a data management plan using the appropriate tool 
* Recognize the value of creating a DMP
```

```{admonition} There are different activities in this module you should complete:
:class: tip

## Topic 2: Introduction to DMP online

This introduction will provide you with a step-by-step guide for creating a DMPonline account and with an explanation of its main features. You can create your own account and explore the TU Delft template.

With DMPonline you can:

-   Write your plan and easily update it throughout the lifecycle of your project;
-   Share your plan with internal and external collaborators and ask for feedback from your Faculty Data Steward;
-   Download your plan in a variety of formats.
    
There are multiple tools that can help you write a data management plan (DMP). TU Delft provides researchers with the tool [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/?perform_check=false) (Link directs you to the TU Delft institutional DMP online instance).

```{admonition} Suggested Activity - Getting started with creating a DMP
:class: tip, dropdown
In this activity you will be creating an account for DMPonline, and use the TU Delft template to create a plan for your project. In the following document, [DMPonline user guide](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/common/viewFile.d2lfile/Content/637384388228502429/DMPonline%20user%20guide_Jan.2020.pdf?ou=297772&fid=L2NvbnRlbnQvZW5mb3JjZWQvMjk3NzcyLWNvdXJzZS11Y28tZ3MtMjAyMC1yNGExLTAxL0RNUG9ubGluZSB1c2VyIGd1aWRlX0phbi4yMDIwLnBkZg), you will find a clear step-by-step guide to complete this activity. 

We expect you to:

✅ Create an account in DMPonline/
✅ ‘Create a new plan’ for your project choosing:/

1. ‘Delft University of Technology’ as the primary research organisation. 
2.  Tick ‘No funder associated with this plan or my funder is not listed’ in the ‘primary funding organisation’.
3. Fill in the ‘Project Details’ according to your project.
4. Go to ‘Write Plan’.

✅ Go back to your slides or papers and post-it’s of your data flow map of week 1 and 2 and use the information in there to fill in the questions of the data management plan. If appropriate, you can use the ‘Additional Information’ box in the template to add as many details as possible according to your data flow map./
✅ If you don’t know how to answer any of the questions please let us know in the Discussion. We would also like to hear your reflections that came up while filling in the DMP.
