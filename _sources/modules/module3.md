# Module 3 - FAIR data principles and their main elements

(section-label-1)=

In this module, we will discover the FAIR data principles and their main elements. At the end of this module, you should be able to:

-   Understand the FAIR principles and their relation to RDM
-   Identify key elements that help make research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)
    

There are different activities in this module you should complete:

-   Read topic 1: Why and how were the FAIR principles created?
-   Watch the video about the key elements to make data FAIR and complete the ‘fill in the blanks’ quiz


## Topic 1: Why and how were the FAIR principles created?

Why and how were the FAIR principles created? Read the associated text to learn more.

The FAIR principles were created in order to maximize the reuse of scientific data, to promote best practices on Research Data Management and to enable Open Science.

Applying the FAIR principles means to make research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable1.

-   Findable means that others (both human and machines) can discover the data  
-   Accessible means that the data can be made available to others
-   Interoperable means that the data can be integrated with other data and can be easily used by machines or in data analysis workflows.
-   Reusable means that the data can be used for new research
    
These four principles should be applied (as much as possible) throughout the entire research cycle and they are closely interconnected with each other.

**The FAIR Data principles are NOT:**

-   A standard. The FAIR principles need to be adapted and followed as much as possible by considering the research practices in your field. FAIR principles should be rather seen as progressive steps that help you make your data re-usable.
    
-   Equivalent to Open Data. FAIR data does not necessarily mean openly available: it should be clear to others that the data exists and which steps they could take to potentially access the data.
    
-   Applied using a particular technology or tool. There might be different tools that enable FAIR data within different disciplines or research workflows.
    

There are important elements to consider within your research workflows if you aim to make the data of your project FAIR:

-   Documentation & Metadata
-   Interoperability    
-   Access to data  
-   Persistent identifiers 
-   Licences
    
In the next videos we will explore these different elements and their importance to make the data of your project FAIR.

## Videos: Key elements to make data FAIR

What are the key elements to make data FAIR? In the following videos we will explain these elements and give you the opportunity to test your knowledge.

The objective of the following videos is to identify the key elements that help make research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). The following videos are an elaboration on these key elements of FAIR. Test your knowledge afterwards with the 'Fill in the missing words' assignment beneath.

### Summary

By now, you have learned about different elements that help you make the data of your project FAIR. Many of them are straightforward to implement in your daily work, for example organizing your files and folders, keeping documentation of the data, reflecting about data access, etc. Other elements might require special tools or at least special tools would make your work easier. We will talk about some tools for documentation and data publication when we meet in the virtual class of Module 4.
