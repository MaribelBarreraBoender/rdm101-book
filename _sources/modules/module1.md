# Module 1: The importance of RDM
The first module of this course is all about awareness. Why do we find RDM so important? During this module we will share different perspectives about the importance of RDM in ensuring research reproducibility.

```{admonition} At the end of this module you should be able to:
* Recognize the importance of research data management 
* Explain why RDM is relevant for reproducibility and re-use of data
```

## Why care about RDM?

Watch the presentation about the importance of RDM and hear what other researchers have as their worst nightmare. Why should you be aware of your Research Data Management?

An instructor has recorded a video to explain the importance of RDM and different perspectives on it. She shares horror stories and discusses the reproducibility aspect of research data management.

```{admonition} Suggested activity - Are you up for some games?
:class: tip, dropdown

✅ To get in the mood for reproducibility or to escape yourself from some horror stories while having fun, we suggest you try one of these games:
✅ You can find more in [{bdg-primary}`ReproJuice: The reproducibility game via this link`](http://thebarngames.nl/repro/).
✅ You can play the ‘Data Horror Escape room’: [{bdg-primary}'Data Horror Escape room'](https://sites.google.com/vu.nl/datahorror/home).
✅ You can play the ‘Software Horror Game’: [{bdg-primary}'Software Horror Game'](https://nlesc.github.io/softwarehorrorgame/SoftwareHorrorGame.html).
