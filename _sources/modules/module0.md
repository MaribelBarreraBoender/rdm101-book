# Course information

This course provides PhD candidates with the essential knowledge and the core skills to manage research data according to best practice. You will be able to integrate good data management practices into your workflow from the start of your research project. Applying this knowledge to your research will allow you to reflect on how to work with your research data in an efficient and reproducible way, while meeting funder and institutional requirements.

## Learning Objectives

```{admonition} After completing this course, you will be able to:
* Realise the important role that good data management plays in research.
* Identify different types of research data and recognize the regulations, policies and/or legal requirements associated with them.  
* List the main components of the FAIR data principles and connect them to your own research workflows. 
* Employ the acquired knowledge to design an efficient research data management strategy for your projects according to best practices.
