# Getting started

Whether you write your book's content in Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or
in regular markdown files (`.md`), you'll write in the same flavor of markdown
called **MyST Markdown**.
This is a simple file to help you get started and show off some syntax.

## Course Information


This course provides PhD candidates with the essential knowledge and the core skills to manage research data according to best practice. You will be able to integrate good data management practices within your workflow from the beginning of your projects. The application of this knowledge to your research will allow you to reflect on how to work efficiently and in a reproducible manner with your research data, while complying with funders and institutional requirements.


**Learning Objectives:**

After completing this course, you will be able to:

 - Realize the important role that good data management plays in research

- Identify different types of research data and recognize the regulations, policies and/or legal requirements associated with them.

- List the main components of the FAIR data principles and connect them to your own research workflows.

- Employ the acquired knowledge to design an efficient research data management strategy for your projects according to best practices.

<sup>1</sup> The order of the slides in the video is slightly different.  
<sup>2</sup> This lecture will be significantly updated. Stay tuned.  
Here is a "note" directive:

```{note}
Here is a note
```

It will be rendered in a special box when you build your book.

Here is an inline directive to refer to a document: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`.


## Citations

You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:

```{bibliography}
```
