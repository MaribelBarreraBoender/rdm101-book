# Module 5 - How to plan for RDM

In Module 5 we will take a closer look at planning for RDM. In relation to this, data management plans and the tool DMPonline will be developed.

```{admonition} At the end of this module you should be able to:
* Recognise the relevance of planning research data management   
* Get familiar with the concept of DMP and its format 
* Create a data management plan using the appropriate tool 
* Recognise the value of creating a DMP
```

```{admonition} There are different activities in this module you should complete:
:class: tip
‚úÖ Watch the animation üìΩÔ∏è video to learn what a data management plan (DMP) is\
‚úÖ Watch the üìΩÔ∏è videos of a TU Delft researcher and a Faculty data steward to learn why they think it is relevant to prepare a DMP\
‚úÖ Complete the suggested activity of creating a DMP using the tool DMP online
```   

## 5.1 Data Management Plan (DMP)

Watch the following üìΩÔ∏è video for an introduction on what a data management plan is and its key elements.

### Additional reading: What is a Software Management Plan?
If you are working with computer code or developing software within your PhD project, merely sharing the code/software is insufficient to guarantee the reproducibility of research. You will need to think about the ways of sharing the code/software underpinning your research in a proper manner. A Software Management Plan helps to implement best practices during software development and ensures that software is accessible and reusable in the short and longer term. It also contributes to the reproducibility of results and stimulates collaborative work on open-source software for research.

## 5.3 Introduction to DMPonline

This introduction will provide you with a step-by-step guide for creating a DMPonline account and with an explanation of its main features. You can create your own account and explore the TU Delft template.

With DMPonline you can:

-   Write your plan and easily update it throughout the lifecycle of your project;
-   Share your plan with internal and external collaborators and ask for feedback from your Faculty Data Steward;
-   Download your plan in a variety of formats.
    
There are multiple tools that can help you write a data management plan (DMP). TU Delft provides researchers with the tool [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/?perform_check=false) (Link directs you to the TU Delft institutional DMP online instance).

```{admonition} Suggested Activity - Getting started with creating a DMP
:class: tip, dropdown
In this activity you will be creating an account for DMPonline, and use the TU Delft template to create a plan for your project. In the following document, [DMPonline user guide](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/common/viewFile.d2lfile/Content/637384388228502429/DMPonline%20user%20guide_Jan.2020.pdf?ou=297772&fid=L2NvbnRlbnQvZW5mb3JjZWQvMjk3NzcyLWNvdXJzZS11Y28tZ3MtMjAyMC1yNGExLTAxL0RNUG9ubGluZSB1c2VyIGd1aWRlX0phbi4yMDIwLnBkZg), you will find a clear step-by-step guide to complete this activity. 

We expect you to:

‚úÖ Create an account in DMPonline/
‚úÖ ‚ÄòCreate a new plan‚Äô for your project choosing:/

1. ‚ÄòDelft University of Technology‚Äô as the primary research organisation. 
2.  Tick ‚ÄòNo funder associated with this plan or my funder is not listed‚Äô in the ‚Äòprimary funding organisation‚Äô.
3. Fill in the ‚ÄòProject Details‚Äô according to your project.
4. Go to ‚ÄòWrite Plan‚Äô.

‚úÖ Go back to your slides or papers and post-it‚Äôs of your data flow map of week 1 and 2 and use the information in there to fill in the questions of the data management plan. If appropriate, you can use the ‚ÄòAdditional Information‚Äô box in the template to add as many details as possible according to your data flow map./
