## 3.1 FAIR data principles
### Why and How Were the FAIR Principles Created?


The  **FAIR** principles were created in order to maximise the reuse of scientific data, to promote best practices on Research Data Management and to enable Open Science.

Applying the FAIR principles means to make research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.

-   **Findable** means that others (both human and machines) can discover the data
    
-   **Accessible** means that the data can be made available to others
    
-   **Interoperable** means that the data can be integrated with other data and can be easily used by machines or in data analysis workflows.
    
-   **Reusable** means that the data can be used for new research
    

These four principles should be applied (as much as possible) throughout the entire research cycle and they are closely interconnected with each other.

It is vital for you to know that the FAIR Data principles **are NOT****:**

-   **A standard.** The FAIR principles need to be adapted and followed as much as possible by considering the research practices in your field. FAIR principles should be rather seen as progressive steps that help you make your data reusable.
    
-   **Equivalent to Open Data.** FAIR data does not necessarily mean openly available: it should be clear to others that the data exists and which steps they could take to potentially access the data.
    
-   **Applied using a particular technology or tool.** There might be different tools that enable FAIR data within different disciplines or research workflows.
    

There are important elements to consider within your research workflows if you aim to make the data of your project FAIR:

-   **Documentation & Metadata**
-   **Interoperability**    
-   **Access to data**    
-   **Persistent identifiers**    
-   **Licences**
    

In the next üìΩÔ∏è videos we will explore these different elements and their importance to make the data of your project FAIR.


### üìΩÔ∏è Videos: Key elements to make data FAIR

The objective of the following videos is to identify the key elements that help make research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). The following videos are an elaboration on these key elements of FAIR. Test your knowledge afterwards with the 'Fill in the missing words' quizzes.

### Summary

By now, you have learned about different elements that help you make the data of your project FAIR. Many of them are straightforward to implement in your daily work, for example organising your files and folders, keeping documentation of the data, reflecting about data access, etc. Other elements might require special tools or at least using special tools would make your work easier. We will talk about some tools for documentation and data publication in Module 4.

### Additional Resource: How do the FAIR principles apply to software?


**If Research Software is one of the main outputs of your projects, we strongly recommend you to take** **a couple of extra minutes exploring this section!**

To improve the sharing and reuse of research software, more than 500 contributors around the globe worked for two years in the creation of the ‚ÄòFAIR Principles for Research Software‚Äô (FAIR4RS). Many of the FAIR Guiding Principles for research data can be directly applied to research software by treating software and data as similar digital research objects. However, specific characteristics of software ‚Äî such as its executability, composite nature, and continuous evolution and versioning ‚Äî make it necessary to revise and extend the principles. Let‚Äôs hear from Maurits, one of TU Delft research software engineers, how the FAIR principles apply to Research Software and the distinction between FAIR software and open source:

If you develop software within your PhD project, we highly encourage you to follow the FAIR software checklist prepared by the TU Delft Digital Competence Center (DCC):  [https://tu-delft-dcc.github.io/docs/software/checklist.html](https://tu-delft-dcc.github.io/docs/software/checklist.html)
